# Udacity-Deployment-Project

The Jupyter-Notebook-File [SageMaker_Project.ipynb](SageMaker_Project.ipynb) includes my
solution to the Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model-Project in the Deeplearning-Nanodegree. 

## Description

A recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM-cells is built to decide whether a given movie review
is positive or negative. For this task the RNN is trained with the IMDb dataset. The model is
built and deployed with the cloud machine-learning platform Amazon SageMaker. After deployment
a Lambda function and an API Gateway is set up to access the trained RNN-model with a simple 
Web-App.

The Web-App can be started by opening the [index.html](index.html)-file in a browser.
